# DepMap Analysis

DepMap Analysis is a project that aims at providing an automated framework 
for explaining high-throughput scientific data.

## Source of crispr data

We use the CRISPr data from the Dependency Map 
[portal](https://depmap.org/portal/) managed by the Broad Institute.

## Indra DepMap Service

The INDRA DepMap Service is a web service that exposes the (pre-)assembled 
knowledge in INDRA for network path searches. Currently the service can only 
be run locally. For an example, see the 
[notebook](https://github.com/kkaris/depmap_analysis/blob/readme/notebooks/Run%20Local%20Service.ipynb).

## Funding

DepMap Analysis is funded as part of the DARPA Automated Scientific Discovery 
Framework (ASDF), grant number W911NF018-1-0124.
